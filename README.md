Python Pandas code for manipulating data from http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/trip-history-data.

The .csv files from that website show trip history data from D.C.'s bike-sharing system.  

This module requires Pandas for Python, which is available at http://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html.  

To use this module, use the read_csv() Pandas method to import a downloaded .csv file.

An example plot showing the net gain/loss of bikes at the 5 most active stations over the 2nd quarter of 2013 is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9vId7Tu0tjMYmpDdWtwN3hpd28/edit?usp=sharing.
